How to contribute:

Contributing to the content of Unkiverse requires you to be on the board with other contributors, for now, 
viewing the content is for everyone but editing and modifying Unkiverse's content is limited to the internal team.


There is two kinds of contributions to the content of Unkiverse:

1) The one that you simply "know" and can recall at any time, this piece of information can simply be added 
to the .txt file without further actions, e.g. the universe is expanding constantly and in an accelerated matter.

2) The one that you don't know and/or you cant recall so you do your own research and find out about it, 
this kind of contribution requires an additional step after adding this piece of information to the .txt file, 
you need to go the file that is called "Sources" and add the reference
under the given name of the category like the following:


a. Internet link: *URL* 

b. Book, magazines, newspapers: *Author's name, medium's name, page's number.*
